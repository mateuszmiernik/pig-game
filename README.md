# 🎲 Pig Game

Pig Game is a fun and strategic two-player dice game where players take turns rolling dice to accumulate points. The twist? Roll a `1`, and you lose all points for that turn!

## 🕹️ How to Play

- Two players take alternating turns.
- On a turn, a player can:
  - **Roll the dice**:
    - If the result is **not 1**, the number is added to the turn's current score.
    - If the result **is 1**, the player loses all points for that turn and it's the other player's turn.
  - **Hold**:
    - Adds the turn score to the total score and passes the turn to the other player.
- The first player to reach **100 points** wins the game.
